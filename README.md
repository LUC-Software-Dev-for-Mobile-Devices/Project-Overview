# Project Overview 
The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in developing a mobile application using .NET MAUI and integrating a RESTful API to retrieve and display data.  You will be required to design, develop and test an application that fetches data from the API and displays it in a user-friendly way.

This project will require you to use a variety of skills, including programming, design, and project management. You are also permitted to work independently or as part of a team.

By the end of the project, you should be able to:
- Explore the structure of a cross-platform mobile app project and understand its components. 
- Build a simple cross-platform mobile application using XAML to create the user interface. 
- Examine the various layout options and learn how to use them effectively. 
- Design interfaces that apply styles, visual design components, and themes to ensure consistency across different platforms 
- Practice implementing data binding to connect the user interface to a data source. 
- Construct code to serialize and deserialize data between the application and data sources and interact with RESTful web services and retrieve data from external APIs.

## General Requirements
The application should use XAML to create the user interface. The user interface should be visually appealing, and it should be easy to use.

Choose a RESTFul  API that you want to integrate into your mobile application. There are many public APIs available that you can use, such as weather APIs, news APIs, or sports APIs. You can find a list of public APIs here: [https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).  A less exhaustive source includes APIs that can be found here: [https://apipheny.io/free-api/](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)
 
Implement the API integration using RESTful API calls and display the retrieved data on the appropriate screens.

At a minimum, your .NET MAUI project should include the  following screens:
1. A home screen that displays the app's main features and a navigation menu.
2. A screen to display a list of items retrieved from the API.
3. A screen to display details about a specific item.

Plan your mobile application. Identify how the features will be implemented, think through when and how you will fetch data from the API, think through how the data will be rendered in a user-friendly way, and think through how end-users users will interact with the data. You should also consider the navigation, and how end-user will operate your mobile app.

The application should be able to display a list of items from the API, and users should be able to filter the list on two of the data fields.
 
The application should implement error handling and display appropriate error messages if the API call fails.

You will need to test the application on an Android or iOS emulator and ensure that it functions correctly.

## Deliverables
You will provide three deliverables that are organized into three assignments.  Each assignment will hone in on the general requirements listed above. 

- Assignment 1 will focus on planning the application. You will  1) identify the API, 2) document the tools and strategies you will use to complete requirements, 3) state the mission and purpose of the app, 4) identify application architecture
- Assignment 2 will focus on the design of the interface.  You will 1) create wireframes for each screen of your application, 2) code each of the interfaces using XAML and 3) create the necessary event handler methods your application will use.
- Assignment 3 will focus on 1) creating the class diagram, 2) Making calls to the API, and 3) implementing the model and using the application logic to display and visualize data in the view.
The assignments above will use the same repository.  You will document each assignment of this project by using a README.md file listed at the root level of your project repository.
